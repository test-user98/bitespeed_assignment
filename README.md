Hello There,

I have added the code in the main.js file, I have used:
express and mysql to achieve solution to this problem.

Problem statement:
https://bitespeed.notion.site/Bitespeed-Backend-Task-Identity-Reconciliation-53392ab01fe149fab989422300423199

This is the curl POST request you can use:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "email": "mcfly@hillvalley.edu",
  "phoneNumber": "123456"
}' http://localhost:3000/identify

Let me know if anything needs to be done for you to test this properly?
